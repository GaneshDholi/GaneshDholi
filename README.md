# Hi 👋 I'm Ganesh Dholi

I’m a developer who enjoys building real, usable products.

Most of my work is around **full-stack web development (MERN)**, Firebase, and cloud-based tools.  
I like taking ideas from scratch — designing the UI, writing the backend, connecting the database, and deploying it properly.

I study **Cyber Security**, which helps me think about security while coding, but my main focus is **development, systems, and product building**.
